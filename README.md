# graph-generator

this is a program of graph generator using opengl in c++.we take input string as equation and it generates graph of that equation.
equation pattern
sin(x)
sin(x)+cos(x)
log2(cos(sinx))
and for all mathematical equations
compile mainn.cpp with c++ std 11 and install opengl in c++
first install opengl
to run use following commands
 g++ -std=c++11 mainn.cpp -o gl -lGL -lGLU -lglut
./gl
